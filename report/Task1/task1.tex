\section{Image Collection}

\paragraph{Task 1} We were instructed to capture to sets of images. The subject of both sets was an object placed in a 3D calibration grid and the difference between the two sets was the type of transformation between the images in said set. The first set \textbf{FD}, has images which horizontally pivoted around the grid, whilst the second set \textbf{HG}, contained images taken from the same position but with varying zoom and rotation. See Appendix \ref{apx:fd} and Appendix \ref{apx:hg} for the \textbf{FD} and \textbf{HG} sets respectively.
